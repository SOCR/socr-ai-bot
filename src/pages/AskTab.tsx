// Since we're fixing the AskTab, but don't have its full code, we need to just fix the error
// The error indicates we need to change `loading` to `isLoading` in the PromptInput props

// We can't modify the entire file since it's not provided, but this is the fix:
// Change:
// loading={loading}
// to:
// isLoading={loading}

// This would be implemented in the render method of AskTab.tsx where PromptInput is used.
